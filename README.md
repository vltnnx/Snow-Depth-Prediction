# Snow Depth Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict snow depth in Finnish ski centers by using historical data to train machine learning models.

## Project components
1. Data collection: Data collected from FMI* and NASA's POWER project**
2. Data pipeline: Clean and modify data using Python
3. Machine Learning: Models trained using scikit-learn, future data extrapolated using Prophet
4. Data visualisation: Figures created using Matplotlib

*temperature, cloud cover, snow depth
*solar radiation
